# Skype Addon

This addon ports some features from Dug Lee's excellent [jaws scripts for Skype](http://www.dlee.org/skype/skypeman6.php) for the classic desktop version of Skype.

All commands match those in the jaws scripts as closely as possible.

## Available Commands

* NVDA+Ctrl+0 through 9: read the 10 most recent messages when focus is on a conversation. This is implemented by a built-in app module. This is subject to change.
* Ctrl+2: moves focus to the list of recent conversations.
* Ctrl+3 (unimplemented): Moves focus to the list of active calls.
* Ctrl+4: moves focus to the message history for the active conversation.
* Ctrl+5: moves focus to the message input field for the active conversation.
* Ctrl+6: virtualizes the message history for the active conversation for convenient review and copying. This is subject to change.
